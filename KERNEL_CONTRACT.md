# ASI Kernel Contract

This kernel exists to enforce one rule:

> **Never relearn known pain.**

## Non-negotiables
1. Recorded failures must never be deleted.
2. Known-deadly actions must be blocked by default.
3. Explanations are optional; preventing recurrence is not.
4. One agent’s failure must reduce population-wide risk.
5. Silent failure is forbidden.

## Definitions
- **Failure**: an outcome that violates constraints, produces harm, or proves a claim unusable.
- **Lesson**: structured negative knowledge that reduces future failure probability.
- **Guardrail**: a rule derived from lessons that blocks recurrence.
- **Adversarial example**: a convincing-wrong artifact that often slips past naive evaluation.

## Design stance
Clarity > cleverness  
Survival > speed  
Memory > confidence
