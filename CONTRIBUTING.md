## What we want
- Better failure taxonomies
- Cleaner lesson → guardrail derivations
- Tools for ingesting “convincing wrongness”
- Demo tasks that reveal evaluator blind spots

## What to include in PRs
- The failure you’re addressing
- The lesson format you propose
- A demo showing the guardrail prevents recurrence

## Style
Prefer boring code and explicit logic.
The kernel should be readable by a tired engineer at 2am.
