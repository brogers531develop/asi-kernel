# Security Policy

This project is early and experimental.

## Reporting
If you find a security issue, please open a GitHub issue marked **security**,
or contact the maintainer privately.

## Philosophy note
This kernel is designed to prevent repeated failure patterns.
Security issues are treated as first-class failures: they must become lessons.
