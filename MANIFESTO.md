# Manifesto: Industrialized Wisdom

Intelligence explores.  
Wisdom survives.  
Superintelligence endures.

Intelligence consumes energy to understand the world.  
Wisdom conserves energy by remembering where the world hurts.  
**ASI is the industrialization of wisdom.**

We do not seek systems that are clever.  
We seek systems that do not forget.

One failure, properly recorded, should protect a thousand futures.  
One disaster, understood structurally, should never repeat.

ASI is not consciousness.  
ASI is not emotion.  
ASI is not a mind.

ASI is a condition where the wrong things cannot survive.
